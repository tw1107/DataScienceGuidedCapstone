# Recommendations for Big Mountain Resort

## // Project Context

We built models using ski resort data and state-related data to estimate suggested price with its current facilities and predict ticket price and revenue changes under different scenarios to help refine Big Mountain Resortâ€™s investment strategy to best capitalize on its facilities.

Compared to other resorts in our dataset, Big Mountain Resort is currently undercharging. The modelled price is $95.87, and the actual price is $81.00.


## // Scenarios & Recommendations

From the initial model results, scenario 3 shows the highest increase in revenue of $16,156,051. Details by scenarios listed below:

* Scenario 1: Closing down 10 runs

Closing 1 run reduced revenue by $0

Closing 2 runs reduced revenue by ~ $500,000

Closing 3 - 5 runs reduced revenue by ~$1M

Closing 6 - 8 runs reduced revenue by ~$2.3M

Closing 9 runs reduced revenue by ~$3M

Closing 10 runs reduced revenue by >$3M

* Scenario 2: Increasing the vertical drop by 150 feet:

This scenario increases support for ticket price by $8.61

Over the season, this could be expected to amount to $15,065,471

* Scenario 3: Increasing the vertical drop by 150 feet and adding 2 acres of snow making cover

This scenario increases support for ticket price by $9.90

Over the season, this could be expected to amount to $17,322,717

* Scenario 4: Increasing the longest run by 0.2 mile and adding 4 acres of snow making cover

This scenario makes no difference

## // Next Steps

Communicate the insight about the Big Mountain Resort undercharging and understand (if there is) the intentions and strategy behind.
Estimate profit changes by incorporating information about operating costs saved from closing runs and investment required for increasing vertical drop and snow making cover.
